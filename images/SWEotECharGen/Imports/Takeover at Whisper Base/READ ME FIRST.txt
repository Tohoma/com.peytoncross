Takeover at Whisper Base
------------------------

This folder contains adversaries, encounters, and custom vehicles that can be used with Takeover at Whisper Base, the adventure that comes with the Age of Rebellion Beginner Game.  This assumes that you have the adversaries from Age of Rebellion imported into your adversaries collection.  If not, import "Imperial Stormtropper" from the "AoR Core Adversary Import" directory.

The encounters follow the encounters outlined in the Adventure Book.  If playing with more or less than four PCs, you will need to adjust the number of NPCs, as described in the book.

This folder also contains a data set that can be imported to give you the new vehicles described in this adventure.

To include these new items in your system:

1. Run the data editor and Import the data set found in the "Takeover at Whisper Base Import\Data Sets" folder.  This will add the rusted ATST and Comm Tower to your custom data.
2. Run the GM Tools.
3. Import all adversaries found in the "Takeover at Whisper Base Import\Adversaries" folder (use Import from the Adversaries pane).  
4. Import the "Imperial Stormtrooper" from the "AoR Core Adversary Import" directory (use Import from the Adversaries pane, if you haven't already imported this adversary).
5. Import the encounters found in the "Takeover at Whisper Base Import\Encounters" folder (use Import from the Encounters pane).
