Operation: Shell Game
---------------------

This folder contains encounters that can be used with Operation: Shell Game, the adventure that comes with the AoR Beta rulebook.  It also contains a data set that can be imported to give you the Shell Cracker starship, as well as a stock vehicle for the Shell Cracker for convenience.

To include these new items in your system:

1. Run the data editor and Import the data set found in the Data Sets folder.  This will add the Shell Cracker vehicle to your custom data.
2. Run the GM Tools.
3. Import all adversaries found in the "AoR Adversary Import" folder off of the main Imports folder.  The encounters included in this package use adversaries from the main AoR Beta rulebook, which can be found in that folder.
4. Import the encounters found in the Encounters folder (use Import from the Encounters pane).
5. Import the stock vehicle found in the Stock Vehicles folder (use Import from the Stock Vehicles pane).

If the encounters don't have any adversaries in them, then you didn't import the main AoR adversaries before importing the encounters (step 3).
