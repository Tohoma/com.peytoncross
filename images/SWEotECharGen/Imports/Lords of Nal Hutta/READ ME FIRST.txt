Lords of Nal Hutta
------------------

This folder contains adversaries and encounters that can be found in the Lords of Nal Hutta sourcebook.  The adversaries are organized by location, with the rest being used for modular encounters.  The encounters are used for combat encounters found in modular encounters, at the end of the book.

Note:  Some encounters may include adversaries found in other Nal Hutta locations, not just the Modular Encounters folder.  As such, you should import all adversaries before importing the encounters.

To include these new items in your system:

1. Run the GM Tools.
2. Import adversaries found in the "Lords of Nal Hutta Import\Adversaries" folder (use Import from the Adversaries pane).  Import whatever you need, or all of them if you plan on using encounters as well.
3. If you want to use the encounters, import the encounters found in the "Lords of Nal Hutta Import\Encounters" folder (use Import from the Encounters pane).
