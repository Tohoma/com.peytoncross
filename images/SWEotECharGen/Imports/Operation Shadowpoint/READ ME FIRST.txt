Operation: Shadowpoint
----------------------

This folder contains adversaries, encounters, and custom vehicles that can be used with Operation: Shadowpoint, the bonus adventure that continues Takeover at Whisper Base that comes with the Age of Rebellion Beginner Game.  This assumes that you have the adversaries from Age of Rebellion imported into your adversaries collection.  If not, import "Imperial Stormtropper", "Imperial Army Trooper", and "Imperial Army Officer" from the "AoR Core Adversary Import" directory.

The encounters are actually just a basis for the possible encounters you can have in this adventure.  You may need to create more encounters, depending on what your players do, and you also may need to modify the included encounters.

This folder also contains a data set that can be imported to give you the new vehicles described in this adventure.

To include these new items in your system:

1. Run the data editor and Import the data set found in the "Operation Shadowpoint Import\Data Sets" folder.  This will add the Modified Tie Bomber and the Retrofitted AT-AT to your custom data.
2. Run the GM Tools.
3. Import all adversaries found in the "Operation Shadowpoint Import\Adversaries" folder (use Import from the Adversaries pane).  
4. Import the "Imperial Stormtrooper", "Imperial Army Trooper", and "Imperial Army Officer" from the "AoR Core Adversary Import" directory (use Import from the Adversaries pane, if you haven't already imported these adversary).
5. Import the encounters found in the "Operation Shadowpoint Import\Encounters" folder (use Import from the Encounters pane).
