The Perlemian Haul
------------------

This folder contains adversaries, encounters, and custom vehicles that can be used with The Perlemian Haul, the adventure that comes with the Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook.  This assumes that you have the adversaries from Age of Rebellion imported into your adversaries collection.  If not, import "Imperial Navy Trooper" from the "AoR Core Adversary Import" directory.

The included encounters are only a sample of common encounters that can be played with this adventure.  You will more than likely have to add your own custom encounters, or further customize the included encounters, as you play through the adventure.

This folder also contains a data set that can be imported to give you the new vehicles described in this adventure.

To include these new items in your system:

1. Run the data editor and Import the data set found in the "Perlemian Haul Import\Data Sets" folder.  This will add the heavy freighter and the cargo skiff to your custom data.
2. Run the GM Tools.
3. Import all adversaries found in the "Perlemian Haul Import\Adversaries" folder (use Import from the Adversaries pane).  
4. Import the "Imperial Navy Trooper" from the "AoR Core Adversary Import" directory, if you plan on using this adversary (use Import from the Adversaries pane).
5. Import the encounters found in the "Perlemian Haul Import\Encounters" folder (use Import from the Encounters pane).
