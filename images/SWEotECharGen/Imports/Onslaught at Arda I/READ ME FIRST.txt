Onslaught at Arda I
-------------------

This folder contains adversaries, encounters, stock vehicles, and custom items that can be used with Onslaught at Arda I, an adventure module for use with Age of Rebellion.

The data set contains specialized vehicles that are used for this adventure.  The TIE Hunter and MSP100 are actually part of the base data for the apps, as they are general-purpose vehicles.  The following custom data may be found in this data set:

 - Alliance T-47 Sandspeeder (modified from the one found in AoR)
 - Arda I Anti-Infantry Laser Cannon (a stationary artillery piece)
 - Arda I Anti-Vehicle Laser Cannon (another stationary artillery piece)
 - Doran'enok, in its vehicle configuration
 - Ord Radama Landspeeder
 - Specialized vehicle weapons for the above vehicles

The encounters are organized by episode, with just the established encounters included.  You may need to create more encounters, depending on what your players do, and you also may need to modify the included encounters.

Stock vehicles include the two laser cannon artillery pieces that can be used in Episode 1 for Phases 2 and 4 of "Special Operations".

To include these new items in your system:

1. Run the data editor and Import the data set found in the "Onslaught at Arda I Import\Data Sets" folder.  This will add the above vehicles and weapons to your custom data.
2. Run the GM Tools.
3. Import all adversaries found in the "Onslaught at Arda I Import\Adversaries" folder (use Import from the Adversaries pane).  
4. Import the encounters found in the "Onslaught at Arda I Import\Encounters" folder (use Import from the Encounters pane).
5. Import the stock vehicles found in the "Onslaught at Arda I Import\Stock Vehicles" folder (use Import from the Stock Vehicles pane).
