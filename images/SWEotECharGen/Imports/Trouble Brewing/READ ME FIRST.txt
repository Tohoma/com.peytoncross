Trouble Brewing
---------------

This folder contains adversaries, encounters, and custom vehicles that can be used with Trouble Brewing, the adventure that comes with the Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook.  This assumes that you have the adversaries from Edge of the Empire imported into your adversaries collection.  If not, import "Pirate Crew", "Smuggler", and "Street Tough" from the "EotE Core Adversary Import" directory.

This folder also contains a data set that can be imported to give you the new vehicles described in this adventure.

To include these new items in your system:

1. Run the data editor and Import the data set found in the "Trouble Brewing Import\Data Sets" folder.  This will add the sentry droid and the Z-TIE to your custom data.
2. Run the GM Tools.
3. Import all adversaries found in the "Trouble Brewing Import\Adversaries" folder (use Import from the Adversaries pane).  
4. Import the "Pirate Crew", "Smuggler", and "Street Tough" adversaries from the "EotE Core Adversary Import" directory (use Import from the Adversaries pane).
5. Import the encounters found in the "Trouble Brewing Import\Encounters" folder (use Import from the Encounters pane).
